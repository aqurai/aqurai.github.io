I am Anwar Ahmad Quraishi. I currently work as a SLAM / Sensor Fusion engineer at [Fixposition](https://www.fixposition.com/), where I develop the localization and mapping pipeline for their product, [Vision-RTK 2](https://www.fixposition.com/pages/our-product). I also develop algorithms for robust fusion of vision with GNSS in urban canyons and other degraded GNSS scenarios.

Previously, I obtained my PhD from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), advised by [Prof. Alcherio Martinoli](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/people/team/alcheriomartinoli/) at [DISAL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/). For my thesis, I developed localization and coordination algorithms for a swarm of underwater robots. As a part of my work, I also developed acoustic ranging and communication hardware to aid underwater localization. My work was deployed in different Swiss lakes on several occaisions, for water quality monitoring using [Hydromea Vertex underwater robots](https://www.hydromea.com/vertex-autonomous-underwater-swarm). More information about my work can be found [here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/research/auvdistributedsensing/).

I received my Masters degree in Robotics from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in 2015, and my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). 

I have been building robots for more than a decade. While at IIT Hyderabad, I started and lead a hobby robotics club together with [Krishna Manaswi Digumarti](https://krishnamanaswid.github.io/).
